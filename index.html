            <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio. My name is Blake Neely, I am a front end padawan on his way to becoming a full stack ninja. My love for coding began way back in the late 90s when I took an "Intro to the Interwebs" class in highschool. We created basic html pages that can best be descirbed as a lesson in how to create Geocities monstrosities.</p>

            <p>While getting my bachelor's in Marketing at Middle Tennessee State University I again dabbled in html and css, I had to have that perfect background and the music playing just right on my Myspace page. I soon graduated and began my career in banking for a few years before I transitioned over to Verizon.</p>

            <p>Over the last year I've spent time off and on learning more html, css, and JavaScript on my own. As I see people consuming web applications more and more now with mobile technology I've decided to gain a full understanding of front and back end web development for a career change.
            </p>

            <p>I'm eager to learn and excited to begin my journey!</p>
